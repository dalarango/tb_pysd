		Stock Management Structure 1
		John Sterman (1999) Business Dynamics.  Irwin/McGraw-Hill
		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman
		
		This is the generic stock management structure, developed in chapter 17.
		Units are acquired with an exogenous acquisition delay, and orders are based
		on replacement of expected losses adjusted to bring the stock and supply line up
		to their desired levels.
		
		In this version, the desired supply line is based on the desired acquisition rate
		and includes the adjustment for the stock (equation 17-16). The indicated order rate \
		depends on
		the desired acquisition rate adjusted to bring the supply line up to its desired \
		level.
		
		The model is parameterized for capital investment.
	|

"Desired Stock S*"=
	Initial Desired Stock*Input
	~	Units
	~	The desired stock  is exogenous.  A variety of test inputs allow users to try \
		different patterns,
		         including a step, pulse, sine wave, and random noise.
	|

Input=
	1+STEP(Step Height,Step Time)+
	(Pulse Quantity/TIME STEP)*PULSE(Pulse Time,TIME STEP)+
	RAMP(Ramp Slope,Ramp Start Time,Ramp End Time)+
	Sine Amplitude*SIN(2*3.14159*Time/Sine Period)+
	  	STEP(1,Noise Start Time)
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Input is a dimensionless variable which provides a variety of test input patterns, \
		including a step,
		         pulse, sine wave, and random noise.
	|

Desired Acquisition Rate DAR=
	Expected Loss Rate EL + Adjustment for Stock AS
	~	Units/Year
	~	The desired acquisition rate is expected losses adjusted to bring the stock
		in line with the desired level.
	|

Indicated Orders IO=
	Desired Acquisition Rate DAR +  Adjustment for Supply Line ASL
	~	Units/Year
	~	Indicated orders are based on the deired acquisition rate, then adjusted for to \
		close any
		gap between the desired and actual supply line.
	|

Stock S= INTEG (
	Acquisition Rate AR-Loss Rate LR,
		"Desired Stock S*")
	~	Units
	~	The stock accumulates acquisitions less discards.
	|

Adjustment for Stock AS=
	("Desired Stock S*" - Stock S)/Stock Adjustment Time SAT
	~	Units/Year
	~	The adjustment for the stock is proportional to the gap between the \
		desired and actual stock.
	|

Noise Start Time=
	1
	~	Year
	~	Start time for the random input.
	|

Sine Period=50
	~	Years
	~	Period of sine wave in customer demand.  Set initially to 50 weeks (1 \
		year).
	|

Pulse Quantity=0
	~	Dimensionless*Year
	~	The quantity to be injected to customer orders, as a fraction of the base value of \
		Input. 
		        For example, to pulse in a quantity equal to 50% of the current value of \
		input, set to
		         .50.
	|

Ramp End Time=1e+009
	~	Year
	~	End time for the ramp input.
	|

Ramp Slope=0
	~	1/Year
	~	Slope of the ramp input, as a fraction of the base value (per week).
	|

Sine Amplitude=0
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Amplitude of sine wave in customer orders (fraction of mean).
	|

Step Height=0
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Height of step input to customer orders, as fraction of initial value.
	|

Step Time=
	1
	~	Year
	~	Time for the step input.
	|

Initial Desired Stock=
	 100
	~	Units
	~	Initial value of the desired stock.
	|

Pulse Time=
	1
	~	Year
	~	Time at which the pulse in Input occurs.
	|

Ramp Start Time=
	1
	~	Year
	~	Start time for the ramp input.
	|

Acquisition Lag AL=
	1.5
	~	Years
	~	The average delay between order and acquisition of new units.
	|

Adjustment for Supply Line ASL=
	("Desired Supply Line SL*" - Supply Line SL)/Supply Line Adjustment Time SLAT
	~	Units/Year
	~	The order rate is adjusted to close any gap between the desired and actual \
		supply line.
	|

Average Lifetime L=
	8
	~	Years
	~	The average life of units in the stock is assumed to be 8 years.
	|

"Desired Supply Line SL*"=
	Expected Acquisition Lag EAL*Desired Acquisition Rate DAR
	~	Units
	~	The desired supply line maintains sufficient units on order to yield the 
		desired acquisition rate.
	|

Expected Acquisition Lag EAL=
	Acquisition Lag AL
	~	Years
	~	The expected delay between order and acquisition of new units.  Assumed in this 
		simple model to equal the actual acquisition lag, but is modeled more realistically
		as an information delay of the actual value.
	|

Loss Rate LR=
	Stock S/Average Lifetime L
	~	Units/Year
	~	First order discards with a constant average life are assumed.
	|

Supply Line Adjustment Time SLAT=
	2
	~	Years
	~	The time period over which the gap between the desired and actual supply \
		line is closed.
	|

Stock Adjustment Time SAT=
	2
	~	Years
	~	The time period over which the gap between the desired and actual stock is \
		closed.
	|

Acquisition Rate AR=
	Supply Line SL/Acquisition Lag AL
	~	Units/Year
	~	The acquisition rate is determined by the quantity on order and the average \
		acquisition delay.
		In this simple model, the acquisition delay is first-order, but in general can be any
		high-order process.
	|

Expected Loss Rate EL=
	Loss Rate LR
	~	Units/Year
	~	Expected losses in this simple model are assumed to equal the actual loss \
		rate.
	|

Order Rate OR=
	MAX(0,Indicated Orders IO)
	~	Units/Year
	~	The order rate is constrained to be nonnegative.  Cancellations should be modeled \
		explicitly
		as a separate outflow from the supply line.
	|

Supply Line SL= INTEG (
	+Order Rate OR-Acquisition Rate AR,
		"Desired Supply Line SL*")
	~	Units
	~	The quantity on order; what has been ordered but not yet received.
