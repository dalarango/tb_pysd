		First-order stock management model
		John Sterman (1999) Business Dynamics.  Irwin/McGraw-Hill
		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman
		
		This model, developed in chapter 17, is the first-order stock-management
		structure.  The acquisition rate equals the desired acquisition rate,
		that is, there is no acquisition delay.
	|

Input=
	1+STEP(Step Height,Step Time)+
	(Pulse Quantity/TIME STEP)*PULSE(Pulse Time,TIME STEP)+
	RAMP(Ramp Slope,Ramp Start Time,Ramp End Time)+
	Sine Amplitude*SIN(2*3.14159*Time/Sine Period)+
	  	STEP(1,Noise Start Time)
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Input is a dimensionless variable which provides a variety of test input patterns, \
		including a step,
		         pulse, sine wave, and random noise.
	|

Adjustment for Stock AS=
	("Desired Stock S*" - Stock S)/Stock Adjustment Time SAT
	~	Units/Year
	~	The adjustment for the stock is proportional to the gap between the \
		desired and actual stock.
	|

"Desired Stock S*"=
	Initial Desired Stock*Input
	~	Units
	~	The desired stock  is exogenous.  A variety of test inputs allow users to try \
		different patterns,
		         including a step, pulse, sine wave, and random noise.
	|

Stock S= INTEG (
	Acquisition Rate AR-Loss Rate LR,
		"Desired Stock S*")
	~	Units
	~	The stock accumulates acquisitions less discards.
	|

Pulse Quantity=0
	~	Dimensionless*Year
	~	The quantity to be injected to customer orders, as a fraction of the base value of \
		Input. 
		        For example, to pulse in a quantity equal to 50% of the current value of \
		input, set to
		         .50.
	|

Pulse Time=
	1
	~	Year
	~	Time at which the pulse in Input occurs.
	|

Ramp Slope=0
	~	1/Year
	~	Slope of the ramp input, as a fraction of the base value (per week).
	|

Sine Amplitude=0
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Amplitude of sine wave in customer orders (fraction of mean).
	|

Initial Desired Stock=
	 100
	~	Units
	~	Initial value of the desired stock.
	|

Step Time=
	1
	~	Year
	~	Time for the step input.
	|

Noise Start Time=
	1
	~	Year
	~	Start time for the random input.
	|

Sine Period=50
	~	Years
	~	Period of sine wave in customer demand.  Set initially to 50 weeks (1 \
		year).
	|

Step Height=0
	~	Dimensionless
	~	Height of step input to customer orders, as fraction of initial value.
	|

Ramp End Time=1e+009
	~	Year
	~	End time for the ramp input.
	|

Ramp Start Time=
	1
	~	Year
	~	Start time for the ramp input.
	|

Acquisition Rate AR=
	MAX(0, Desired Acquisition Rate DAR)
	~	Units/Year
	~	The acquisition rate is determined by th desired acquisition rate (no acquisition \
		delay), but 
		constrained to be nonnegative.
	|

Average Life=
	8
	~	Years
	~	The average life of units in the stock is assumed to be 8 years.
	|

Desired Acquisition Rate DAR=
	Expected Loss Rate EL + Adjustment for Stock AS
	~	Units/Year
	~	The desired acquisition rate is expected losses adjusted to bring the stock
		in line with the desired level.
	|

Expected Loss Rate EL=
	Loss Rate LR
	~	Units/Year
	~	Expected losses in this simple model are assumed to equal the actual loss \
		rate.
	|

Loss Rate LR=
	Stock S/Average Life
	~	Units/Year
	~	First order discards with a constant average life are assumed.
	|

Stock Adjustment Time SAT=
	3
	~	Years
	~	The time period over which the gap between the desired and actual stock is \
		closed.
	|

	|

FINAL TIME  = 10
	~	Year
	~	The final time for the simulation.
	|

INITIAL TIME  = 0
	~	Year
	~	The initial time for the simulation.
	|

SAVEPER  = 
        TIME STEP
	~	Year
	~	The frequency with which output is stored.
	|

TIME STEP  = 0.0625
	~	Year
	~	The time step for the simulation.
