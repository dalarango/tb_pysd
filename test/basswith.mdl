		The Bass Innovation Diffusion Model with Discards
		John Sterman (1999) Business Dynamics.  Irwin/McGraw-Hill
		Copyright (c) 1999 John Sterman
		
		This is the classic Bass innovation diffusion model, adapted
		to include discards of the product and repurchases.  Adopters
		discard their units after an average lifetime and reenter the
		market as potential adopters.
		Chapter 9.
	|

Adopters A= INTEG (
	Adoption Rate AR - Discard Rate,
		0)
	~	Units
	~	The number of active adopters in the system.  Increased by adoption and \
		decreased when adopters discard their unit and reenter the market.
	|

Potential Adopters P= INTEG (
	-Adoption Rate AR + Discard Rate,
		Total Population N - Adopters A)
	~	Units
	~	The initial number of potential adopters is determined by the total \
		population size and the current number of active adopters.  It is reduced \
		by adoption and increased when adopters discard their old unit and reenter \
		the market.
	|

Adoption Rate AR=
	Adoption from Advertising + Adoption from Word of Mouth
	~	Units/Year
	~	The rate at which a potential adopter becomes an active adopter. This is \
		driven by advertising efforts and the word of mouth effect.
	|

Advertising Effectiveness a=
	0.011
	~	1/Year
	~	Advertising results in adoption according the effectiveness of the \
		advertising.
	|

Adoption from Advertising=
	Advertising Effectiveness a*Potential Adopters P
	~	Units/Year
	~	Adoption can result from advertising according to the effectiveness of the \
		advertising effort with the pool of potential adopters.
	|

Total Population N=
	1e+006
	~	Units
	~	The size of the total population.
	|

Adoption from Word of Mouth=
	Contact Rate c*Adoption Fraction i*Potential Adopters P*Adopters A/Total Population N
	~	Units/Year
	~	Adoption by word of mouth is driven by the contact rate between potential \
		adopters and active adopters and the fraction of times these interactions \
		will result in adoption. The word of mouth effect is small if the number \
		of active adopters relative to the total population size is small.
	|

Contact Rate c=
	100
	~	1/Year
	~	The rate at which active adopters come into contact with potential \
		adopters.
	|

Adoption Fraction i=
	0.015
	~	Dimensionless
	~	The fraction of times a contact between an active adopter and a potential \
		adopter results in adoption.
	|

Average Product Life l=
	5
	~	Year
	~	The average life of the product.
	|

Discard Rate=
	Adopters A/Average Product Life l
	~	Units/Year
	~	The discard rate is assumed to be first-order, with an average product \
		life l.

FINAL TIME  = 10
	~	Year
	~	The final time for the simulation.
	|

INITIAL TIME  = 0
	~	Year
	~	The initial time for the simulation.
	|

SAVEPER  = 
        TIME STEP
	~	Year
	~	The frequency with which output is stored.
	|

TIME STEP  = 0.0625
	~	Year
	~	The time step for the simulation.
